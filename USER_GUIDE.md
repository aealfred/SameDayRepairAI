This is for when you are diagnosing a new appliance for the first time.

1.  Under the "**Start a New Diagnosis**" section, click the button corresponding to the appliance you are working on (e.g., Washer, Dryer, Refrigerator).
2.  This will start a new chat session. The AI will greet you and ask for more information.
3.  Use the input area at the bottom to provide details and answer the AI's questions.

### Option B: Continue a Past Job

If you have already started a diagnosis and want to continue where you left off, your previous sessions will be listed on the right side.

1.  Find the job you wish to continue in the "**Continue a Past Job**" list.
2.  Click on the job item.
3.  The full conversation history for that job will be loaded into the chat window, ready for you to continue.
